You have to move the ESP8266FS folder into your ardunio tools folder to install the Arduino ESP8266 Filesystem Uploader and to upload the index.html and data folder on your NodeMCU.

In your Arduino folder, create a new folder called "tools" and put the ESP8266 folder inside. Restart your Arduino IDE after that.

In your Arduino IDE click, connect to your NodeMCU and click: tools -> ESP8266 sketch data uplaod. Wait until it is finished.
